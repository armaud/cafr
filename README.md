# Correlation Aware Filter Reduction Algorithm

A filter pruning algorithm for series deep convolutional neural networks.
Optimization code are built on matlab r2018a and can be easily used in later versions.

Main.m is the file which loads dataset and contain function callbacks.

There are multiple function files for the same project with differences. Kindly, read content from each file for better understanding.

This algorithm is tested on series networks only (VGG models and user defined models) and can be translated to resnets and detection models with minor changes.


If this algorithm is used or extended, kindly acknowledge the contributions of authors.
